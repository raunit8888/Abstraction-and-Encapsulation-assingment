    "#Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "### Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of OOP. It involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant parts to the user. This means providing a simplified interface to interact with the objects while keeping the complex internal workings hidden from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points of Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simplification:** Abstraction helps in simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "2. **Hiding Complexity:** It hides the internal workings and implementation details, exposing only what is necessary for the user.\n",
    "3. **Enhancing Reusability:** By defining clear interfaces, abstraction promotes code reusability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example of a simple `BankAccount` class that abstracts the details of a bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Definition\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self.account_number = account_number\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > 0:\n",
    "            self.__balance += amount\n",
    "            print(f\"Deposited: ${amount}\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Invalid deposit amount.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:\n",
    "            self.__balance -= amount\n",
    "            print(f\"Withdrawn: ${amount}\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Invalid withdraw amount or insufficient balance.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the BankAccount Class\n",
    "my_account = BankAccount(\"1234567890\", 1000)\n",
    "my_account.deposit(500)\n",
    "my_account.withdraw(200)\n",
    "print(f\"Current Balance: ${my_account.get_balance()}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "- **Class Definition (`BankAccount`):** The `BankAccount` class represents a bank account. It has an `__init__` method to initialize the account number and balance. The balance is a private attribute (`__balance`) to restrict direct access from outside the class.\n",
    "- **Methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `get_balance`):** The class provides methods to deposit money, withdraw money, and check the balance. These methods provide a simplified interface to interact with the bank account without exposing the internal implementation details.\n",
    "- **Private Attribute (`__balance`):** The balance is kept private to prevent direct modification, ensuring that deposits and withdrawals are made through the defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the user interacts with the `BankAccount` class through its public methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `get_balance`) without needing to know the internal details of how the balance is stored or modified. This abstraction simplifies the user's interaction with the bank account and hides the complexity of the underlying implementation."

    "#Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "### Abstraction vs. Encapsulation in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** are two core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, and while they are related, they serve different purposes. Let's explore their differences and how they are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** To reduce complexity and increase efficiency by exposing only the relevant parts of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bark\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def animal_sound(animal):\n",
    "    print(animal.make_sound())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the Animal class\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Bark\n",
    "animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In this example, the `Animal` class provides an abstract interface (`make_sound` method) that is implemented by the `Dog` and `Cat` classes. The user of the `Animal` class does not need to know how `Dog` or `Cat` classes implement the `make_sound` method; they only need to know that they can call `make_sound` to get the respective animal sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** Encapsulation is the technique of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** To protect the internal state of an object and to ensure that the objectâ€™s internal representation is hidden from the outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self.account_number = account_number\n",
    "        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount > 0:\n",
    "            self.__balance += amount\n",
    "            print(f\"Deposited: ${amount}\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Invalid deposit amount.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:\n",
    "            self.__balance -= amount\n",
    "            print(f\"Withdrawn: ${amount}\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Invalid withdraw amount or insufficient balance.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self.__balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the BankAccount class\n",
    "my_account = BankAccount(\"1234567890\", 1000)\n",
    "my_account.deposit(500)\n",
    "my_account.withdraw(200)\n",
    "print(f\"Current Balance: ${my_account.get_balance()}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In this example, the `BankAccount` class encapsulates the data (`account_number` and `__balance`) and the methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `get_balance`) that operate on that data. The `__balance` attribute is private, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. This prevents direct manipulation of the account balance and ensures that all changes to the balance are made through the defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose:**\n",
    "   - **Abstraction:** Hides complexity by showing only the essential features.\n",
    "   - **Encapsulation:** Protects an object's internal state by bundling the data and methods together and restricting access to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Focus:**\n",
    "   - **Abstraction:** Focuses on the observable behavior of an object.\n",
    "   - **Encapsulation:** Focuses on hiding the internal state and ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implementation:**\n",
    "   - **Abstraction:** Achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "   - **Encapsulation:** Achieved through access modifiers (private, protected, public) and by defining methods to access and modify the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combined Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Both concepts often work together in OOP. Consider a `Car` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.__year = year  # Private attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Car: {self.__year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"The engine of the {self.make} {self.model} is now running.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the Car class\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2022)\n",
    "my_car.display_info()  # Output: Car: 2022 Toyota Corolla\n",
    "my_car.start_engine()  # Output: The engine of the Toyota Corolla is now running.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Here, the `Car` class encapsulates the `make`, `model`, and `__year` attributes and provides methods to interact with these attributes. The `__year` attribute is private, ensuring that it cannot be directly accessed or modified. The methods `display_info` and `start_engine` provide an abstract interface to interact with the car object, hiding the complexity of how these actions are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates both abstraction (through the simplified methods) and encapsulation (through the private attribute and controlled access)."

    "#Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes, which can be used to define abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. This is a part of Python's support for object-oriented programming, enabling a more structured approach to designing interfaces and ensuring that certain methods are implemented in derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use the `abc` Module?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining Abstract Methods:** Abstract methods are methods that are declared in a base class but contain no implementation. Subclasses are required to provide concrete implementations of these methods. This helps in defining a clear interface for the subclasses.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Enforcing Method Implementation:** By using abstract base classes, you can enforce that certain methods must be implemented in any subclass. This is useful for ensuring that a consistent API is followed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Polymorphism:** Abstract base classes enable polymorphism by allowing different classes to be treated as instances of the abstract base class, as long as they implement the required methods.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Design Contracts:** They help in designing contracts within your codebase, making it clear what methods a class should implement and raising a `TypeError` if an attempt is made to instantiate a class that hasn't implemented all the abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the use of the `abc` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract Base Class Definition\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bark\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trying to instantiate the abstract base class will raise an error\n",
    "# animal = Animal()  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instantiate the subclasses and use them\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(dog.make_sound())  # Output: Bark\n",
    "print(cat.make_sound())  # Output: Meow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "- **Animal (Abstract Base Class):** The `Animal` class is an abstract base class. It inherits from `ABC`, which stands for Abstract Base Class.\n",
    "- **Abstract Method (`make_sound`):** The `make_sound` method is an abstract method, denoted by the `@abstractmethod` decorator. This method has no implementation in the `Animal` class.\n",
    "- **Subclasses (`Dog` and `Cat`):** The `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from `Animal` and provide concrete implementations of the `make_sound` method.\n",
    "- **Instantiation:** Attempting to instantiate the `Animal` class directly will raise a `TypeError` because it contains an abstract method. Only subclasses that implement the abstract methods can be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using the `abc` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Readability:** It makes the code more readable and easier to understand by explicitly stating which methods need to be implemented in subclasses.\n",
    "2. **Error Prevention:** It helps prevent errors by ensuring that subclasses implement all the required methods.\n",
    "3. **Structured Design:** It promotes a more structured and disciplined approach to designing classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `abc` module in Python is a powerful tool for defining abstract base classes and enforcing a consistent interface in object-oriented programming."
